# Quick Start for Bare Metal/VM installs
This document explains installation of Luna Streaming for Bare Metal/VM deployments with a Pulsar tarball. 
The resulting Luna Streaming deployment includes: 
  - Tiered Storage: Offload historical messages to more cost effective object storages such as AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, and HDFS.
  - Built-in Schema Registry: Guarantee messaging type safety on a per-topic basis without relying on any external facility.
  - Pulsar I/O connectors: Enables Pulsar to exchange data with external systems, either as sources or sinks.
  - Pulsar Function: Lightweight compute extensions of Pulsar brokers which enable real-time simple event processing within Pulsar.
  - Pulsar SQL: SQL-based interactive query for message data stored in Pulsar.
  - Pulsar Transactions: enables event streaming applications to consume, process, and produce messages in one atomic operation.
